# Recipify

This is my 4th year project undertaken during my time at DCU with my project partner Bryan.

The aim of the project is to get personalised recipe recommendations for each user based on a variety of factors ranging from dietary restrictions to the weather.

We also wanted to improve our skills with Javascript, React and Next JS.
